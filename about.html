      <p>
        Earth Art ceramic studio is located in our home and has been evolving
        for several decades. We previously had two other sites and are excited
        about our new home studio in the woods, near the Ashokan Reservoir. In
        this unique setting, we explore and experiment with clay as well as some
        Zentangling and on occasion a little yoga.

        At the elementary school age, students learn basic hand building
        techniques: pinch, coil, and slab. We explore many glazing and under
        glazing techniques, as well as advanced decorative methods. Older
        students, grades 6 and up, learn to throw on the wheel. The focus is on
        form and texture. As we learn, grow, and begin to explore the many
        possibilities of clay, students begin to communicate and express
        themselves. We look at many cultures and artists through their pottery.
        In an inviting, nurturing setting, with very small class sizes, students
        begin to create and grow with clay.
